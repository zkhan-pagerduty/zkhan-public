Hi everyone,

I have created this repository to share my Python projects and other like-minded stuff that we as a team can collobrate with.

First up, is a game of "tic tac toe", that I have recently scripted as part of my Python upskilling training. Just download the tictactoe.py, run it, play it and share your feedback with me.

Much appreciated.

Thanks!
